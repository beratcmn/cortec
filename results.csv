"""Does CorroLogic AST provide protection against pitting corrosion?""","""CorroLogic AST is an engineered solution designed to mitigate soil-side corrosion on storage tank bottoms. While the documents do not explicitly mention pitting corrosion, the solution is designed to reduce the overall corrosion rate, which should theoretically include all forms of corrosion, including pitting. Lab tests and field applications have shown that CorroLogic Powder can reduce corrosion rate by a percentage between 80% and 95% in the absence or presence of cathodic protection.""","CorroLogic AST is an engineered solution designed to mitigate soil-side corrosion on storage tank bottoms. It is typically composed of four main system components:

1. Vapor phase corrosion inhibitor products, which can be CorroLogic Powder or CorroLogic Slurry depending on the application methodology.
2. A corrosion monitoring system to monitor the corrosion before and after the introduction of VpCI material.
3. A chime area seal system to close the gap between the annular plates and the ring wall.

While the documents do not explicitly mention pitting corrosion, the system is designed to provide comprehensive corrosion protection for storage tank bottoms. This would generally include protection against common forms of corrosion, such as pitting. However, for specific applications or conditions, it would be best to consult with a corrosion protection specialist or directly with CORTEC for more detailed information."

"""What Type of solution do you recommend for a tank under construction?""","""As an AI, I can provide a general recommendation based on common practices in the industry. For a tank under construction, it's crucial to consider corrosion protection solutions. One such solution could be the use of Cortec's CorroLogic system, which is designed to protect tank bottoms from soil-side corrosion. The CorroLogic system includes Vapor phase Corrosion Inhibitors (VpCIs) that protect metal in enclosed spaces. When applied to the tank bottom, these VpCIs form a protective molecular layer on the metal surface that inhibits corrosion. However, the best solution would depend on the specific conditions and requirements of the tank, such as its size, the material it's made of, the environment it's in, and the substance it will store. Therefore, it's recommended to consult with a corrosion protection specialist or a representative from Cortec for a solution tailored to your specific needs.""","For a tank under construction, CORTEC recommends the use of its Vapor phase Corrosion Inhibitors (VpCIs). These are designed to provide corrosion protection for metal components and parts enclosed in a non-ventilated space. 

VpCIs are especially effective for protecting metal parts in enclosed spaces such as tanks, containers, packages, and other sealed or hard-to-reach areas. They work by evaporating into the air and then condensing on all metal surfaces, even those that are difficult to reach directly.

For tanks, CORTEC's CorroLogic System is often recommended. This system is specifically designed for the corrosion protection of aboveground storage tank soil-side bottoms. The CorroLogic System includes VpCI technology, which provides a protective layer on the metal surface that interrupts the electrochemical corrosion process caused by soil-side corrosion.

Please note that the best solution may vary depending on the specific conditions and requirements of the tank under construction. It's always best to consult with a corrosion protection specialist to determine the most suitable solution."
"""What delivery method should be used for tank under construction?""","""For a tank under construction, the delivery method of corrosion protection solutions like Cortec's CorroLogic system would typically involve direct application to the tank bottom before it is placed on the pad. The CorroLogic system is often delivered in the form of a spray, foam, or fog that can be applied to the metal surfaces. This allows the Vapor phase Corrosion Inhibitors (VpCIs) to form a protective molecular layer on the metal surface that inhibits corrosion. However, the exact delivery method can depend on the specific conditions and requirements of the tank and the corrosion protection system being used. It's recommended to consult with a corrosion protection specialist or a representative from Cortec for the most suitable delivery method for your specific situation.""","For a tank under construction, the delivery method of corrosion protection solutions can vary depending on the specific product being used. However, for Vapor phase Corrosion Inhibitors (VpCIs) and the CorroLogic System, the delivery method typically involves the following steps:

1. **Preparation**: Before the application of the corrosion protection solution, the tank should be properly cleaned and prepared. This may involve removing any existing rust or corrosion, and ensuring the surface is clean and dry.

2. **Application**: The VpCI or CorroLogic solution is then applied to the tank. This can be done through various methods such as spraying, fogging, or injecting the solution into the tank. The method of application will depend on the specific product and the tank's design.

3. **Protection**: Once applied, the VpCI or CorroLogic solution will begin to work by forming a protective layer on the metal surfaces of the tank. This layer will protect the tank from corrosion during the construction process and beyond.

4. **Monitoring**: After the application, it's important to regularly monitor the tank to ensure the corrosion protection solution is working effectively. This may involve visual inspections, as well as more detailed assessments using corrosion monitoring equipment.

Please note that the exact delivery method may vary depending on the specific product and the tank's design and requirements. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and consult with a corrosion protection specialist if needed."
"""what about dispensing system ?""","""For a tank under construction, a dispensing system can be used to apply corrosion protection solutions like Cortec's CorroLogic system. The dispensing system should be designed to effectively distribute the corrosion inhibitor across the entire surface area that needs protection. The CorroLogic system can be dispensed using a variety of methods, including spraying, fogging, or foaming. The choice of dispensing method will depend on the specific conditions and requirements of the tank. In some cases, a more advanced dispensing system may be required. For example, Cortec's CorroLogic system can be delivered via a CorroLogic VpCI Filler, which is a specially designed device that injects the VpCI into the sand pad under the tank. This ensures that the corrosion inhibitor reaches all areas of the tank bottom, providing comprehensive protection. Again, it's recommended to consult with a corrosion protection specialist or a representative from Cortec to determine the most suitable dispensing system for your specific situation.""","CORTEC's CorroLogicÂ® System includes a dispensing system designed for the application of Vapor phase Corrosion Inhibitors (VpCIs) to the soil-side of aboveground storage tank bottoms. 

The dispensing system typically includes the following components:

1. **Injection Ports**: These are installed around the perimeter of the tank bottom. They allow for the controlled injection of the VpCI into the tank's soil-side environment.

2. **Tubing**: This is used to connect the injection ports to the VpCI source. The tubing allows for the VpCI to be evenly distributed around the tank bottom.

3. **VpCI Source**: This is the container or system that holds the VpCI. It can be a simple container or a more complex system depending on the size and requirements of the tank.

4. **Control System**: This is used to control the rate and timing of the VpCI injection. It can be manually operated or automated depending on the system design.

The dispensing system is designed to ensure that the VpCI is evenly and effectively distributed across the tank bottom, providing comprehensive corrosion protection. It's important to note that the exact design and components of the dispensing system may vary depending on the specific requirements of the tank and the corrosion protection solution being used."
