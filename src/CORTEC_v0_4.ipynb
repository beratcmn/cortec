It also attempts to determine \\nthe effect of VPCI on instant -off potential.  Lab-scale tanks  simulating the environment of single bottom \\nstorage tank sitting  on washed sand with  High-density polyethylene  (HDPE ) liner and ICCP  system were \\nconsidered . Corrosion rate for e ach tank was monitored using  Electrical Resistance (ER) pr obe corrosion \\nmonitoring system.  Natural and instant -off potentials of tank bottoms’ steel plates  were also monitored \\nthrough out the experiment using temporary  Copper/Copper -Sulfate  (Cu/CuSO 4) reference electrode. \\nCorrosion  rate data from ER probes indicated that amine carboxylate VPCI  slurry is effective in mitigating \\ncorrosion on carbon steel bottom plates.  The corrosion  rate was reduced  by 82.5% and 89.7% as \\nstandalone and in combination with ICCP respectively.  The study also indicated a shift of the instant -off \\npotential , which might need to be considered by CP operators in the case of using VPCI  in supplementing \\nICCP for protection of  storage tank bottoms.  \\n \\nKey words: vapor phase  corrosion inhibitor,  VPCI , amine carboxylate corrosion inhibitor, impressed \\ncurrent c athodic p rotection , ICCP, aboveground storage tanks , AST, electrical resistance probes,  ER \\nprobes,  cathodic protection criteria, copper/ copper -sulfate reference electrode, Cu /CuSO 4, soil -side \\ncorrosion  \\n  \\n                                                 \\n1 American Petroleum  Institute (API) , 1220 L Street, NW, Washington, DC 20005 -4070, USA  \\n1Paper No.\\n7600\\n©2016 by NACE International.\\nRequests for permission to publish this manuscript in any form, in part or in whole, must be in writing to\\nNACE International, Publications Division, 15835 Park Ten Place, Houston, Texas 77084.\\nThe material presented and the views expressed in this paper are solely those of the author(s) and are not necessarily endorsed by the Association.\\n', metadata={'source': 'Paper_7600_2.pdf', 'page': 0})"

The study presents API 653 floor inspection data on a group of 12 ASTs that had new steel floors installed and were inspected 7-10 years later. VCI was used to control soil-side corrosion on approximately 42% of the tanks and CP was used on the other 58%. The paper concludes that both VCI and CP systems were effective in mitigating corrosion, but there were significant differences in the number of corrosion indications for the tanks using VCI only and those using CP only.

The study presents API 653 floor inspection data on a group of 12 ASTs that had new steel floors installed and were inspected 7-10 years later. VCI was used to control soil-side corrosion on approximately 42% of the tanks and CP was used on the other 58%. The paper concludes that both VCI and CP systems were effective in mitigating corrosion, but there were significant differences in the number of corrosion indications for the tanks using VCI only and those using CP only. The paper suggests that VCI provides a very viable soil-side corrosion solution for AST floors.\"\n",

The study presents API 653 floor inspection data on a group of 12 ASTs that had new steel floors installed and were inspected 7-10 years later. VCI was used to control soil-side corrosion on approximately 42% of the tanks and CP was used on the other 58%. The paper concludes that both VCI and CP systems were effective in mitigating corrosion, but there were significant differences in the number of corrosion indications for the tanks using VCI only and those using CP only. The paper suggests that VCI provides a very viable soil-side corrosion solution for AST floors.\"\n",
