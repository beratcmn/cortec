### Question: "summarize paper number 15065"
#### Old Answer: 
- "I'm sorry, but I couldn't find a summary or relevant information for the paper number 15065 in the available documents. It might be helpful to provide more specific details about the paper or check the paper directly for the information you need."
#### New Answer: 
- The paper titled 'Comparison of VCI and CP Performance Using Floor Scan Data from Several 10-Year Old AST Floors' (Paper No. 15065) provides an analysis of the real-time field performance of stand-alone vapor corrosion inhibitor (VCI) systems in comparison to cathodic protection (CP) systems on aboveground storage tank (AST) floors. The study presents API 653 floor inspection data on a group of 12 ASTs that had new steel floors installed and were inspected 7-10 years later. VCI was used to control soil-side corrosion on approximately 42% of the tanks and CP was used on the other 58%. The paper concludes that both VCI and CP systems were effective in mitigating corrosion, but there were significant differences in the number of corrosion indications for the tanks using VCI only and those using CP only. The paper suggests that VCI provides a very viable soil-side corrosion solution for AST floors.

### Question: "Does CorroLogic AST provide protection against pitting corrosion?"
#### Old Answer: 
- "CorroLogic AST is an engineered solution designed to mitigate soil-side corrosion on storage tank bottoms. While the documents do not explicitly mention pitting corrosion, the solution is designed to reduce the overall corrosion rate, which should theoretically include all forms of corrosion, including pitting. Lab tests and field applications have shown that CorroLogic Powder can reduce corrosion rate by a percentage between 80% and 95% in the absence or presence of cathodic protection."
#### New Answer: 
- Yes, CorroLogic AST (Aboveground Storage Tanks) system is designed to provide protection against various types of corrosion, including pitting corrosion. It uses Vapor phase Corrosion Inhibitors (VCI) to protect the tank floor, which is often susceptible to pitting corrosion due to the presence of water and contaminants.

### Question: "What Type of solution do you recommend for a tank under construction?"
#### Old Answer: 
- "As an AI, I can provide a general recommendation based on common practices in the industry. For a tank under construction, it's crucial to consider corrosion protection solutions. One such solution could be the use of Cortec's CorroLogic system, which is designed to protect tank bottoms from soil-side corrosion. The CorroLogic system includes Vapor phase Corrosion Inhibitors (VpCIs) that protect metal in enclosed spaces. When applied to the tank bottom, these VpCIs form a protective molecular layer on the metal surface that inhibits corrosion. However, the best solution would depend on the specific conditions and requirements of the tank, such as its size, the material it's made of, the environment it's in, and the substance it will store. Therefore, it's recommended to consult with a corrosion protection specialist or a representative from Cortec for a solution tailored to your specific needs."
#### New Answer: 
- For a tank under construction, we recommend using the CorroLogic System. This system is specifically designed for the challenges of protecting tank bottoms while in service. The CorroLogic System includes a range of products such as CorroLogic VpCI Slushing Oil, CorroLogic VpCI Filler, and CorroLogic VpCI-649 BD solutions. These products provide a combination of contact and vapor phase corrosion protection, making them ideal for tanks under construction.

### Question: "What delivery method should be used for tank under construction?"
#### Old Answer: 
- "For a tank under construction, the delivery method of corrosion protection solutions like Cortec's CorroLogic system would typically involve direct application to the tank bottom before it is placed on the pad. The CorroLogic system is often delivered in the form of a spray, foam, or fog that can be applied to the metal surfaces. This allows the Vapor phase Corrosion Inhibitors (VpCIs) to form a protective molecular layer on the metal surface that inhibits corrosion. However, the exact delivery method can depend on the specific conditions and requirements of the tank and the corrosion protection system being used. It's recommended to consult with a corrosion protection specialist or a representative from Cortec for the most suitable delivery method for your specific situation."
#### New Answer: 
- For a tank under construction, the recommended delivery method for corrosion protection solutions is typically through the use of a spray system. This allows for even distribution of the product over the tank's surface. However, the specific method can vary depending on the product being used. For instance, CorroLogic VpCI Slushing Oil can be fogged into the tank, while CorroLogic VpCI Filler can be injected into specific areas. Always follow the product's specific application instructions for best results.

### Question: "what about dispensing system ?"
#### Old Answer: 
- "For a tank under construction, a dispensing system can be used to apply corrosion protection solutions like Cortec's CorroLogic system. The dispensing system should be designed to effectively distribute the corrosion inhibitor across the entire surface area that needs protection. The CorroLogic system can be dispensed using a variety of methods, including spraying, fogging, or foaming. The choice of dispensing method will depend on the specific conditions and requirements of the tank. In some cases, a more advanced dispensing system may be required. For example, Cortec's CorroLogic system can be delivered via a CorroLogic VpCI Filler, which is a specially designed device that injects the VpCI into the sand pad under the tank. This ensures that the corrosion inhibitor reaches all areas of the tank bottom, providing comprehensive protection. Again, it's recommended to consult with a corrosion protection specialist or a representative from Cortec to determine the most suitable dispensing system for your specific situation."
#### New Answer: 
- For dispensing corrosion protection solutions in a tank under construction, a spray system is typically used. This allows for even and thorough distribution of the product. However, the specific dispensing system can vary depending on the product being used and the specific requirements of the tank. It's always best to follow the product's specific application instructions for optimal results.
